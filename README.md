## Start a boilerplate for a new day
`npm run new`
### Special Instructions
Run by modifying `index.js` to point to the puzzle you want to execute.
#### 2019:Day 02
Day 2 requires the use of BigInt which is added to Javascript in ES2020 and I didn't include a polyfill.
This limits the solution to [Javascript engines with BigInt support](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt#Browser_compatibility)

#### 2018:Day 14
Day 14 is fast but needs more memory to complete. Run node with 4GB of heap space:
`node --max_old_space_size=4096 index.js`
